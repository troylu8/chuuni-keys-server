Both the [chuuni keys website](https://chuuni-keys.troylu.com/) and the **chart listing api server** are contained in this repository.

## The chart listing

The [chart listing](https://chuuni-keys.troylu.com/charts.html) is a place to browse, share, and download charts made by other players.

You may view its source code under the `chuuni-listing/` repository.

It's hosted on a spare laptop lying in my room. If the server is down, I probably forgot to plug it in or something.
